\nmy thoughts occur of you.\
\nYou are the flame in my candle\
\nthat lights the darkness of my room,\
\nYou are the scented flowers\
\nthat makes my heart full bloom.\
\n\
\nYou are the butterflies\
\nthat flicker in my stomach all day long,\
\nWhen I know I will be holding you\
\nbefore my day is done.\
\n\
\nYou are the stars that shimmer and shine,\
\nYou light up the skies above\
\nIn this Golden silence\
\nit's truly you I love.\
\n\
\nYou are the thunder of the night,\
\nyour lightning strikes whenever,\
\nInto my soul that makes me whole,\
\nand excites my heart forever.\
\n\
\nYou are my paradise, my oceans wide,\
\nMy mountains standing tall,\
\nSo in this Golden Silence\
\nI love you most of all.\n");
